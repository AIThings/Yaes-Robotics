For the AAMAS paper, I generated output files from following runs 
Interactive Run 0 - 4 in the menu
and then used Matlab files to plot all the graphs. 
I can send all matlab file if you need.

All runs are  running in 
mode == ExperimentMode.PROGRAMMED_RUN

which is automatic mode for running VIP and crowd in the simulation.

We are using four crowd configuration and in each configuration, VIP is running for 10 runs with different start and destination locations. 

Following are the associated functions for 
// Single robot run for fixed configuration 
Run 0 === doSingleRobotFollow()

//// 2 and 3  robots run for fixed configuration 
Run 1 === doMultipleRobotFollow()

// single robot run with TVR algo
Run 2 === doCloseProtectionSingleRobot()

//2 and 3 robot run with QLB algo
Run 3 === doCloseProtectionMultipleRobot()

// //2 and 3 robot run with TVR algo
Run 4 === doMultipleRobotWithTVR()
